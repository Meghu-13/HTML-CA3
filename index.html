            What exactly is "Mental Health"?
            </summary>
            <p>Good question, because “mental health” can mean different things to different people. Mental health is a continuum that stretches from where we’re feeling good to the other end of the continuum where we’re struggling because of a challenge or a condition like depression. Where we are on that continuum is influenced by various factors. Some we can control (how we take care of ourselves or our support networks) and some we can’t (our genetics or how we were raised).
                <br><br>
            When our mental health is strong it can help us thrive. When we’re struggling, we may need to seek out self-care and coping practices, and/or the support of professionals.</p>

            What’s the difference between day-to-day emotional struggles and mental health conditions?
            </summary>
            <p>We can feel depressed or anxious without experiencing a mental health condition such as  depression or an anxiety disorder. Mental health conditions (sometimes referred to as mental illnesses) are defined by the length and intensity of our negative feelings and behaviors. The distinction between feeling anxious and having an anxiety disorder depends on how deeply those feelings affect our lives and how long that impact lasts. The important thing to remember is that mental health conditions are treatable and manageable. With the right support, we can move from struggling back across the continuum to thriving.</p>

            What happens when mental health issues aren’t addressed?
            </summary>
            <p>As much as we may try to cope, most mental health challenges will have a negative impact on our lives. We may struggle in school, lose a job because of performance issues, endure financial stress or damage relationships. And the most severe negative outcomes include substance misuse, dangerous behaviors, self-harm, and suicide. That’s why you should never ignore any concerns you have for the mental health and well-being of yourself or someone you know. Speak up, start conversations and find support. You can learn more about where to start here.</p>

            What are mental health professionals for?
            </summary>
            <p>When we physically feel sick, get injured, or have pain, we go to our doctor.  When things don’t feel right emotionally, think of mental health professionals the same way. Counselors, therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists are trained to help us with everyday stress, navigating tough break-ups, dealing with grief or financial struggles, as well as treating medical conditions like depression. Their support can include talk therapy, medication, lifestyle changes and coping strategies. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and it’s okay to ask for help and get support. Because we all need it sometimes.</p>

            How can we improve and protect our mental health?
            </summary>
            <p>Like our physical health, there are aspects of our mental health that we need to understand and manage the best we can, taking positive actions to feel better today and protecting our emotional well-being from future problems. Actively practicing self-care (exercising, meditation, getting enough sleep) and developing good coping strategies (journaling, talking with friends, gratitude exercises), can make us more resilient and protected when we do face challenges or difficult situations. It’s also important to reach out for support and discuss our feelings if we need it.</p>

            When and how should I reach out for help?
            </summary>
            <p>You can reach out for support any time and for any reason. Some people may think that mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists and counselors, are only for when things get really bad or for medical conditions like depression or eating disorders. But really, these professionals are trained to help us develop plans to deal with stress, manage difficult relationships, cope with tough or traumatic experiences or just feel better and improve our quality of life. If thoughts, feelings or challenges are interfering with work, school, relationships or enjoying life, it’s important to actively reach out for help.</p>

            </summary>
            <p>No matter how close we are to someone, it’s not always easy for them to reveal that they’re in pain or they need help.  So if you sense  that a friend is struggling emotionally or having a hard time, don’t ignore it. Instead start the conversation and be there for them.
